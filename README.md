# Botnet Mitigation - Research Collaboration of Industry &amp; Academy

Biggest challenge we have in our economy is segregated working of several institutions. We took the initiative to bring atleast two of key stake holders together to work in the best interest of society. We presented idea of joint venture which later yielded strategic alliances with various universities in our country.
Several engineering universities have shown great interest and we are involved in their final year project assignment and assessment, we are showing great commitment as our corporate social responsibility to align product of universities with rapidly changing demands of telecom & data engineering market. Moreover, engineering students are pleased to work with industry professionals during their final year studies.

We witnessed that great ideas are being evolved during brainstorming session which were mutually beneficial for both institutions.

We are glad to share details of our first collaborated work:
